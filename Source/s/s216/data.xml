This bill requires the Bonneville Power Administration to make specified settlement payments to the Spokane Tribe in relation to the construction and operation of the Grand Coulee Dam.

Payments made to the tribe may be used or invested in the same manner as other tribal governmental funds.

The initial payment extinguishes all monetary claims that the tribe may have against the United States to a fair share of the annual hydropower revenues generated by the Grand Coulee Dam.</summary>
